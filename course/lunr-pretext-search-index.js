  "body": " Daily Prep 0.2 - What are Differential Equations?   Overview  Differential equations are central to science and engineering because the laws of physics are written in this form and they describe how quantities change over time. You have already encountered and even solved simple differential equations in calculus, even if you did not recognize them. This section illustrates what a differential equation looks like and clarifies key ideas like dependent and independent variables. It also demonstrates that many differential equations can have multiple valid solutions, showing how to check a proposed solution by substitution.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    Recognize what a differential equation is and identify the dependent and independent variables in an example.
