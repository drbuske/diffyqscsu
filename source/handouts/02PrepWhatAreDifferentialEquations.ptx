<title>Daily Prep 0.2 - What are Differential Equations?</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    Differential equations are central to science and engineering 
    because the laws of physics are written in this form and they describe how quantities 
    change over time. You have already encountered and even solved 
    simple differential equations in calculus, even if you did not recognize them. This section 
    illustrates what a differential equation looks like and clarifies key ideas like dependent and independent variables. 
    It also demonstrates that many differential equations can have multiple valid solutions, 
    showing how to check a proposed solution by substitution.

          These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable
          fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting.

          <li>
            <p>
              Recognize what a <em>differential equation</em> is and identify the <em>dependent</em> and 
              <em>independent</em> variables in an example.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Understand that differential equations arise naturally from physical laws 
              such as Newton’s law of cooling.

                    <li>
            <p>
              Verify whether a proposed function is a <em>solution</em> by computing its derivative 
              and substituting into the equation.

          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why differential equations can have infinitely many solutions and 
              interpret how solution families arise (e.g., from arbitrary constants).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Analyze an integral function using the usual techniques from differential calculus.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Analyze how different solutions correspond to different physical scenarios or 
              initial conditions.

          </li>

                    <li>
            <p>
              Interpret the structure of a first‑order linear differential equation and 
              understand how it models time‑varying physical processes (such as oscillating 
              ambient temperature).
