<title>Daily Prep 2.1 - Second Order Linear ODEs</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p> 

In this section, we will learn how to recognize, interpret, and solve second‑order linear ordinary 
differential equations, which take the general form 
    <m>A(x) y'' + B(x) y' + C(x) y = F(x)</m>.  After rewriting such equations in the standardized form 
    <m>y'' + p(x) y' + q(x) y = f(x)</m>, we will explore the foundational structure of linear ODEs, including 
    the distinction between homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations and the crucial fact that no powers 
    or nonlinear functions of <m>y</m>, <m>y'</m>, or <m>y''</m> appear.
A major focus is understanding the principle of superposition, which allows solutions of homogeneous 
equations to be combined into new solutions, and learning how this principle, along with existence and 
uniqueness results, gives linear ODEs a powerful and predictable solution theory.  We will also be introduced 
to the operator viewpoint <m>L y = y'' + p y' + q y</m>, which provides an elegant framework for 
understanding why linear equations behave so systematically.
