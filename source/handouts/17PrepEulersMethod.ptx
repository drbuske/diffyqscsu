<title>Daily Prep 1.7 - Numerical Methods: Euler's Method</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    Many differential equations cannot be solved exactly, yet we still need to
    understand how their solutions behave.  Numerical methods provide a way to
    approximate solutions by replacing the continuous differential equation with
    a sequence of discrete steps that can be carried out by hand, by calculator,
    or by computer.  In earlier chapters, slope fields offered a qualitative
    sense of how solutions evolve.  Numerical methods build on this idea by
    giving a systematic procedure for constructing approximate solution curves.
  </p>

  
  <p>
    The foundational idea is simple: if we know a point on a solution curve and
    its slope, then we can follow that slope a short distance to obtain an
    approximate value of the solution at a nearby point.  Euler’s method, the
    first and simplest numerical technique introduced in this section, does
    exactly this.  Although Euler’s method is only a rough approximation, it
    reveals the key principles that underlie more accurate methods and helps
    establish good computational habits.
  </p>

  
  <p>
    This section emphasizes how to implement numerical procedures, how to
    interpret their results, and how to understand their limitations.  Students
    learn how step size affects accuracy, how numerical instability can appear,
    and why different methods may behave differently even when applied to the
    same differential equation.  By the end of the section, readers will have a
    practical toolkit for approximating solutions and for connecting analytic,
    graphical, and numerical viewpoints.
