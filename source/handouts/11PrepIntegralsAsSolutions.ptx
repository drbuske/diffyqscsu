<title>Daily Prep 1.1 - Integrals as Solutions</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
This section shows how certain first-order differential equations can be solved simply by antidifferentiating. When the equation has the form <m>y' = f(x)</m>, its general solution is just an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> plus a constant. The text also clarifies the difference between definite and indefinite integrals and explains how initial conditions lead to a definite‑integral formula for the solution.

                    Understand that a first-order ODE of the form <m>y' = f(x)</m> is solved by 
                    finding an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>.
