<title>Daily Prep 1.4 - Linear Equations and the Integrating Factor</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
   This section introduces first-order <term>linear differential equations</term> of the form 
   <m>y' + p(x)\,y = f(x)</m> and develops the <term>integrating factor method</term> for 
   solving them. By multiplying the equation by a specially chosen function <m>r(x)</m>, 
   the left-hand side becomes the derivative of a product, allowing the equation to be 
   integrated directly. The integrating factor turns out to be <m>r(x) = e^{\int p(x)\,dx}</m>, 
   and this method provides a systematic way to solve any linear first-order ODE, leading to an 
   explicit formula for the solution when the required integrals can be computed.

There is a `trick' to solving linear first order differential equations described in this section that involves multiplying by a function <m>r(x)</m>.  What differentiation rule lies at the heart of this trick?  [Hint: It is not the power rule.]

</li>

<li>
<p> In <url href="
https://web.uvic.ca/~tbazett/diffyqs/intfactor_section.html#example-18">Example 1.4.1</url>, <m>p(x) = 2x</m>.  Note that <m>\int p(x) \ dx = \int 2x \ dx = x^2 + C</m>.  However, the text simply writes <m>r(x) = e^{\int p(x) \ dx} = e^{x^2}</m> and does not write the arbitrary constant of integration <m>C</m>?  Why is this not necessary?

<li>
<p> Multiply <me>y'+p(x)y = q(x)</me> on both sides by by <m>I(x)</m>. </p>
<ol>
<li><p> What is the left-hand side? </p></li>
<li><p> Compute <m>\left[ I(x)y(x) \right]'</m>.  </p></li>
<li><p> How should $I(x)$ be chosen so that (a) and (b) are always equal?  That is, what (differential) equation must it solve?  </p></li>
<li><p> Solve <m>\displaystyle \frac{dI}{dx} = I(x)\cdot p(x)</m> for <m>I(x)</m> in terms of <m>\int p(x) \ dx</m> using separation of variables. </p></li>

A nitric acid solution flows at a constant rate of 6 L/min into a large tank that initially held 200 L of a 0.5% nitric acid solution.  The solution inside the tank remains stirred and flows out at a rate of 8 L/min.  If the solution entering the tank is 20% nitric acid, determine the volume of nitric acid in the tank after <m>t</m> minutes.  </p>

        <description>  Diagram of a mixing tank showing a 20% acid solution flowing in at 6 liters per minute on the left, and a mixture flowing out at 8 liters per minute on the right. Inside the tank, the variable V(t) represents the volume of nitric acid after t minutes, with the initial condition V(0) = 1 liter.
</description>
      </image>
</figure>


<p> Here, <m>V(0) = (0.005)(200 \ {\textrm{L}}) = 1 \ {\textrm{L}}</m>.  Also, 
<me>\frac{dV}{dt} = (0.2)(6 \ {\textrm{L/min}}) - \left( \frac{ V(t) }{200-2t} \right) (8 \ {\textrm{L/min}}).</me> </p>
<ol>
<li><p> Show that the solution to the initial value problem <me>\frac{dV}{dt} = 1.2 - \frac{4}{100-t} V, \ \ V(0) = 1</me> using an integrating factor is <me>V(t) = 0.4(100-t) - \frac{39}{100^4}(100-t)^4.</me>  </p></li>
<li><p> After how many minutes <m>T</m> is the tank empty?  </p></li>
<li><p> It stands to reason that <m>V(T)=0</m> should hold and our model should be valid for <m>0 \leq t \leq T</m>.  Does the graph of <m>V(t)</m> suggest this to be true? </p></li>

At noon, a tank contains 100 L of solution in which 10 kg of chemical is dissolved.  Solution 
containing 2 kg of the chemical per liter flows into the tank at 5 L/min.  The mixture is 
well-stirred and drawn off at a rate of 4 L/min.  If the tank holds 500 L, when does it 
overflow?  If <m>t</m> measures the number of minutes after noon, what is the mass of chemical, 
<m>x(t)</m>, in the tank (in kg) at any time <m>t</m>?  [Set up an linear initial-value problem 
and solve.]

Consider a tank initially containing 200 gallons of pure water, and start adding saltwater 
(containing 3 ounces of salt per gallon of water) at a rate of 1/2 gallon per minute.  
At the same time, the resulting mixture in the tank is drained at the rate of 1/2 gallon 
per minute.  As usual, the mixture in the tank is thoroughly and uniformly mixed at all 
times.  Assume also that a device (similar to a human liver) is attached to the tank that 
each minute filters out half the salt in a single gallon from the mixture in the tank.  
</p>

<p> Let <m>y(t)</m> denote the number of ounces of salt in the tank at <m>t</m> minutes after we 
  start adding saltwater.  </p>
