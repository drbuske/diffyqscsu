<title>Daily Prep 1.6 - Autonomous Equations</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
   This section introduces <term>autonomous differential equations</term>, equations of the 
   form <m>x' = f(x)</m> whose rate of change depends only on the <em>dependent</em> variable 
   and not on the indpendent variable (which is often time <m>t</m>). Because of this 
   simplification, autonomous equations allow powerful qualitative analysis: 
   identifying equilibrium (constant) solutions, determining critical points 
   where <m>f(x)=0</m>, and analyzing the stability of these equilibria by observing how 
   nearby solutions behave. Using examples such as Newton’s law of cooling and the 
   logistic population model, the section shows how slope fields reveal long‑term 
   behavior—such as convergence to a stable equilibrium or divergence from an unstable 
   one—even without solving the ODE explicitly.

In <url href="

How does the solution to the autonomous IVP <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(y), y(-3) = 1</m> compare to the solution of the IVP <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(y), y(1) = 1</m>?  Can you generalize this idea for any autonomous equation?  A slope field for <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(y)</m> is given in <xref ref="AutonomousSlopeField2026a"/>.  </p>

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
     Analyze stability of equilibrium points by determining whether nearby solutions move toward or away from them.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
     Describe long‑term behavior of solutions (e.g., convergence to stable equilibria, divergence from unstable ones) using graphical evidence alone.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
      Interpret models such as Newton’s cooling law and the logistic equation to understand how nonlinear autonomous equations can produce qualitatively different dynamics.
