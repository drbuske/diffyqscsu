</div> <div class="para">We donâ€™t yet know how to find all the solutions, but intuitively we can at least find some solutions.  Suppose we know that initially the tanks have the same amount of salt.  That is, we have an initial condition such as <span class="process-math">\(x_1(0)=x_2(0) = C\text{.}\)</span>  Then clearly the amount of salt coming and out of each tank is the same, so the amounts are not changing.  In other words, <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = C\)</span> (the constant functions) is a solution:  <span class="process-math">\(x_1' = x_2' = 0\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2-x_1 = x_1-x_2 = 0\text{,}\)</span> so the equations are satisfied.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#sintro_closedbrine-example-1-5" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
</div> <div class="para">Let us think about the setup a little bit more without solving it.  Suppose the initial conditions are <span class="process-math">\(x_1(0) = A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2(0) = B\text{,}\)</span> for two different constants <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  Since no salt is coming in or out of this closed system, the total amount of salt is constant.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(x_1+x_2\)</span> is constant, and so it equals <span class="process-math">\(A+B\text{.}\)</span> Intuitively if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is bigger than <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> then more salt will flow out of tank one than into it.  Eventually, after a long time we would then expect the amount of salt in each tank to equalize. In other words, the solutions of both <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> should tend towards <span class="process-math">\(\frac{A+B}{2}\text{.}\)</span>  Once you know how to solve systems you will find out that this really is so.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#sintro_closedbrine-example-1-6" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
