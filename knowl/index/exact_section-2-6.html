<div class="para">An interpretation of the setup is that at each point <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v} = (M,N)\)</span> is a vector in the plane, that is, a direction and a magnitude. As <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> are functions of <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{,}\)</span> we have a <em class="emphasis">vector field</em>.  The particular vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> that comes from an exact equation is a so-called <em class="emphasis">conservative vector field</em>, that is, a vector field that comes with a potential function <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> such that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{v} = \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} ,\frac{\partial F}{\partial
y} \right) .

<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> be a path in the plane starting at <span class="process-math">\((x_1,y_1)\)</span> and ending at <span class="process-math">\((x_2,y_2)\text{.}\)</span> If we think of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> as force, then the work required to move along <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_\gamma \vec{v}(\vec{r}) \cdot d\vec{r}
=
\int_\gamma M \, dx + N \, dy

F(x_2,y_2) - F(x_1,y_1) .

<div class="para">That is, the work done only depends on endpoints, that is where we start and where we end.   For example, suppose <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is gravitational potential.  The derivative of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> given by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> is the gravitational force. What we are saying is that the work required to move a heavy box from the ground floor to the roof, only depends on the change in potential energy.  That is, the work done is the same no matter what path we took; if we took the stairs or the elevator. Although if we took the elevator, the elevator is doing the work for us. The curves <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y) = C\)</span> are those where no work need be done, such as the heavy box sliding along without accelerating or breaking on a perfectly flat roof, on a cart with incredibly well oiled wheels.</div>
